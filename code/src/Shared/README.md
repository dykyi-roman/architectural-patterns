# Rate Limiting

A mechanism for request rate limiting to protect the API from overload.

## Architecture

└── Presentation/
    └── Http/
        └── Attribute/         # PHP attributes for declarative usage
```

## How it works

1. **Limit definition**: Limits are set declaratively via the PHP attribute `RateLimit`.
2. **Request identification**: Each request is identified by the client's IP address (by default).
3. **Request counting**: Redis stores request counters in keys with automatic expiration.
4. **Limit checking**: EventListener intercepts requests and checks if the limit is exceeded.
5. **Limit exceeded handling**: On exceeding the limit, HTTP 429 is returned with headers containing info.

## Usage

Add a rate limit to a controller or method:

```php
// Method-level limit
#[Route('/api/payments/create', methods: ['POST'])]
#[RateLimit(limit: 100, windowSizeSeconds: 60)] // 100 requests per minute
public function createPayment(Request $request): Response
{
    // ...
}

// Or class-level limit for all methods
#[RateLimit(limit: 1000, windowSizeSeconds: 3600)] // 1000 requests per hour
final class PaymentController
{
    // ...
}
```

## Key features

- **Flexibility**: Different limits for different endpoints
- **Scalability**: Redis provides high performance and cluster support
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new strategies and identification methods
- **Standardization**: Standard HTTP headers are used for clients

## Response when rate limit is exceeded

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "code": 101,
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded for resource 'api_route:create_payment'. Limit: 100. Wait 35 seconds before retrying.",
  "wait_seconds": 35
}
```

With HTTP headers:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit: 100`
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0`
- `X-RateLimit-Reset: 1717133875` (Unix timestamp)
- `Retry-After: 35` (seconds)

## Configuration

Service configuration is in `src/Shared/Resources/config/rate_limiting.yaml`.

# Outbox Pattern

## Overview

The Outbox Pattern is an architectural pattern that ensures reliable delivery of domain events through asynchronous
messaging, guaranteeing data consistency between different services in a distributed system. The main purpose of this
pattern is to solve the "dual write" problem, ensuring that events are not lost in case of failures between their
creation and publication.

## Why Outbox Pattern

1. **Atomicity** — Domain events and business data are stored in a single transaction
2. **Reliability** — Events are not lost even if the messaging system fails
3. **Consistency** — The system maintains consistency between domain state and published events
4. **Isolation** — Event processing happens asynchronously and doesn't block the main execution flow
5. **Idempotence** — The system can process the same event multiple times without side effects

## Architecture Implementation

```

│           └── OutboxEvent.php                   # Outbox event class
└── Presentation/
    └── Console/
        └── Command/                 
            └── ProcessOutboxEventsCommand.php    # Event processing command
```

## How It Works

1. **Event Storage** — When the domain creates an event, it's serialized and stored in the `outbox_events` table along
   with business data transaction
2. **Event Processing** — A background process `OutboxEventProcessor` periodically polls the table for unprocessed
   events
3. **Envelope Creation** — Events are wrapped in an `OutboxMessageEnvelope` with metadata and payload
4. **Message Dispatch** — Envelopes are sent through a message bus (in our case, Symfony Messenger)
5. **Message Handling** — Events are processed by appropriate handlers in the system
6. **Event Deserialization** — `OutboxMessageEnvelopeHandler` deserializes the event payload from JSON using the static
   `fromArray()` method from the `DomainEventInterface`
7. **Event Bus Dispatch** — The deserialized domain event is dispatched to the event bus for further processing

## Implementation Benefits

1. **No Reflection** — We use the static `fromArray()` method for event deserialization without reflection
2. **Type Safety** — All events are strongly typed and implement a common interface
3. **Scalability** — Events can be processed in batches and in parallel
4. **Retry Mechanism** — Retry logic for events that failed to process
5. **Monitoring** — Tracking of processing success and errors

## Usage

### Publishing Events via Repository

```php
// Domain changes automatically register events
$aggregate->doSomething();

// Saving the aggregate via repository publishes events
// The second parameter (true) indicates that events should be saved to the outbox
$this->repository->save($aggregate, true);
```

### Manual Event Publication

```php
// Create domain event
$event = PaymentCompletedEvent::create($paymentId, $amount);

// Publish event through outbox
$this->outboxPublisher->publish($event);
```

### Processing Outgoing Events

Starting the processing via console command:

```bash
bin/console app:process-outbox
```

## Event Processing Flows

### Sending Event to Outbox

1. Aggregate creates domain event
2. Repository saves the aggregate and its events
3. `OutboxPublisher` serializes each event to JSON
4. Events are stored in `outbox_events` table with `is_processed = false`

### Processing Event from Outbox

1. `OutboxEventProcessor` finds unprocessed events
2. Creates `OutboxMessageEnvelope` with metadata and payload
3. Sends envelope through message bus
4. `OutboxMessageEnvelopeHandler` deserializes event from JSON
5. Event is sent to event bus for further processing
6. Outbox event is marked as processed

## Error Handling

1. **Retry Mechanism** — If an error occurs during processing, the `retry_count` is increased
2. **Delayed Processing** — Events with errors can be processed later
3. **Error Logging** — Error description is saved in the `error` field

## Optimizations

1. **Row Locking** — Used to prevent parallel processing of the same event
2. **Batch Processing** — Events are processed in batches for better performance
3. **Table Cleanup** — Processed events can be periodically archived or deleted

# EventStore Pattern

## Overview

Event Store is a pattern used in event-sourced systems to persist and retrieve domain events. Unlike traditional data
storage that keeps only the current state, Event Store maintains a complete history of all events that have affected an
aggregate. This approach enables robust event sourcing, providing a reliable audit log, enhanced debugging capabilities,
and the ability to reconstruct the state of any aggregate at any point in time.

## Architecture Implementation

```
Shared/
└── Infrastructure/
   └── EventStore
       ├── EventStoreInterface.php               # Event Storage Interface               
       └── Repository/                            
           └── OutboxEventRepository.php         # Event Storage Implementation
```

## Usage

### Saving Events via Repository

```php
// Domain changes automatically register events
$aggregate->doSomething();

// Saving the aggregate via repository save events
$this->repository->save($aggregate, true, true);
```

## Purpose

The Event Store pattern serves several crucial purposes:

1. **Immutable Record of Changes**: Captures all domain events as an immutable log of every change in the system
2. **Event Sourcing Support**: Enables rebuilding the state of any aggregate by replaying events
3. **Historical Analysis**: Allows for temporal queries and analyzing how the system evolved
4. **Audit Trail**: Provides a complete audit log for compliance and debugging
5. **System Resilience**: Facilitates recovery scenarios by replaying events

## Implementation Details

In our system, the Event Store is implemented using a Doctrine-based approach:

- **EventStoreInterface**: Defines the contract for storing and retrieving domain events
- **DoctrineEventStore**: Implements the interface using Doctrine DBAL
- **Database Structure**: Events are stored in a dedicated `event_store` table with the following schema:
    - `event_id`: Unique identifier for each event
    - `occurred_at`: Timestamp when the event occurred
    - `event_type`: Fully qualified class name of the event
    - `aggregate_id`: Identifier of the aggregate the event belongs to
    - `event_data`: Serialized event data in JSON format

## Event Store vs. Outbox Pattern

While both patterns deal with domain events, they serve different purposes:

- **Event Store**: Focuses on maintaining the complete history of domain events for event sourcing, allowing state
  reconstruction and historical analysis
- **Outbox Pattern**: Ensures reliable event publishing in distributed systems by temporarily storing events before they
  are dispatched to external systems

In some scenarios, both patterns can be used together - the Event Store maintains the complete event history, while the
Outbox ensures reliable event delivery to external systems.

## Benefits

1. **Complete Audit Trail**: Every change to the domain is recorded and can be queried
2. **Time Travel Debugging**: The ability to reconstruct the state at any point in time
3. **Event Sourcing Support**: Enables advanced architectural patterns
4. **Decoupled Event Consumption**: Events can be consumed by various components without affecting the source
5. **Historical Analysis**: Enables business intelligence and analytics on historical data

## Considerations

1. **Performance**: Reading the current state requires replaying events, which can be optimized with snapshots
2. **Storage Growth**: The event store continuously grows as new events are appended
3. **Schema Evolution**: Care must be taken when changing event schemas to maintain backward compatibility
4. **Query Complexity**: Historical queries may require specialized approaches

# Specifications

Composable specifications for expressing business rules as logical expressions.
Read: https://www.martinfowler.com/apsupp/spec.pdf

### Available operators

- **AndSpecification**: Logical AND (&&)
- **OrSpecification**: Logical OR (||)
- **NotSpecification**: Logical NOT (!)
- **AndNotSpecification**: Logical AND-NOT (&& !)
- **OrNotSpecification**: Logical OR-NOT (|| !)

### Usage

```php
$spec = new AndSpecification(
    new CustomerIsActiveSpecification(),
    new OrNotSpecification(
        new OrderHasItemsSpecification(),
        new OrderIsOverDueSpecification()
    )
);

if ($spec->isSatisfiedBy($customer)) {
    // Action if specification is satisfied
}
```

# ACID Transaction Support

## Overview

Our application implements robust transaction management following the ACID principles:
- **Atomicity**: Transactions are fully completed or fully rolled back
- **Consistency**: The database remains in a consistent state before and after transactions
- **Isolation**: Transactions are isolated from the effects of other concurrent transactions
- **Durability**: Once committed, transaction results are permanent

## Architecture

```
Shared/
├── DomainModel/
│   └── Service/
│       └── TransactionServiceInterface.php    # Transaction service contract
└── Infrastructure/
    └── Persistence/
        └── Doctrine/
            ├── Repository/
            │   └── AbstractDoctrineRepository.php # Repository with transaction support
            └── Transaction/
                └── DoctrineTransactionService.php # Transaction implementation
```

## Implementation Features

1. **Transaction Service Interface**: Domain-layer abstraction for transaction management
2. **Doctrine Transaction Service**: Infrastructure implementation using Doctrine DBAL
3. **Configurable Isolation Levels**: Support for different transaction isolation levels
4. **Retry Mechanism**: Automatic retry for deadlocks or concurrency conflicts
5. **Nested Transaction Support**: Recognition and proper handling of nested transactions

## Isolation Levels

The transaction service supports all standard database isolation levels:

- **READ UNCOMMITTED**: Lowest isolation, allows dirty reads but highest concurrency
- **READ COMMITTED**: Prevents dirty reads, moderate isolation
- **REPEATABLE READ**: Prevents non-repeatable reads, higher isolation
- **SERIALIZABLE**: Complete isolation, prevents all concurrency anomalies but lowest throughput

## Usage Examples

### Basic Transaction

```php
// Simple transaction with automatic commit/rollback
$this->transactionService->execute(function () {
    $this->userRepository->save($user);
    $this->walletRepository->save($wallet);
    
    return $user->getId();
});
```

### Transaction with Custom Isolation Level

```php
use Doctrine\DBAL\TransactionIsolationLevel;

// Execute with serializable isolation for critical operations
$this->transactionService->executeWithIsolationLevel(
    function () {
        $account->withdraw($amount);
        $this->accountRepository->save($account);
    },
    TransactionIsolationLevel::SERIALIZABLE
);
```

### Transaction with Retry for Deadlocks

```php
// Automatically retry up to 3 times if deadlocks occur
$this->transactionService->executeWithRetry(
    function () {
        $product->decreaseStock($quantity);
        $this->productRepository->save($product);
    },
    3, // max retries
    200 // delay in milliseconds between retries
);
```

## Advanced Features

1. **Deadlock Detection**: Automatic detection and handling of database deadlocks
2. **Optimistic Locking**: Version fields to detect concurrent modifications
3. **Transaction Boundary Control**: Explicit transaction management or automatic through repositories

## Benefits of Our ACID Implementation

1. **Data Integrity**: Guaranteed consistency even during failures or concurrent operations
2. **Error Recovery**: Automatic rollback of failed transactions preserves system state
3. **Concurrency Control**: Proper isolation prevents issues with concurrent access
4. **Scalability**: Configurable isolation levels allow balancing consistency and performance

## Best Practices

1. Keep transactions as short as possible to minimize lock contention
2. Choose the appropriate isolation level based on business requirements
3. Use the Outbox pattern for reliable event publication within transactions
4. Implement optimistic locking for entities where appropriate
5. Consider using sagas for long-running business transactions across bounded contexts
